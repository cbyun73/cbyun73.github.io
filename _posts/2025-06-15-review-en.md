✅ Introduction  
As I entered my 50s and started preparing for the second chapter of my life, I realized that AI is no longer optional—it's essential.  
While watching various YouTube videos introducing AI, one figure stood out: **CareerHacker Alex**.  
His approach to ChatGPT and AI was unlike any superficial overview I’d seen before. I thought, “I really want to learn this properly.”  
Fortunately, I found out that Alex himself was offering a **practical ChatGPT course** supported by the Korean government.  
Being able to take such a high-quality course at an incredibly low cost through the national “Naeil Learning Card” program was truly lucky.  
So I didn’t hesitate to enroll—and now I’m confident it was the right decision.

💡 Course Summary  
- **Course Title**: Master ChatGPT in 10 Minutes a Day: From Basics to Practical Use  
- **Provider**: FastCampus (K-Digital Basic Competency Training / Government-funded program)  
- **Duration**: May 28, 2025 – June 16, 2025  
- **Why I Enrolled**:  
  I needed structured AI learning to prepare for my second career, and I didn’t want to miss the chance to take a hands-on course by CareerHacker Alex at a low cost through government funding.

🛠️ What I Did During the Course

1. **Understanding and Relearning ChatGPT**  
   - In the first week, I studied how ChatGPT works and realized I had only scratched the surface.  
   - I experienced how **"good questions yield better answers"**, and I began using ChatGPT not just as a chatbot, but as a productivity and thinking tool.

2. **Prompt Engineering for Image Analysis (Week 2)**  
   - I learned how to guide ChatGPT’s responses intentionally.  
   - This helped me significantly enhance an ongoing AI-based image analysis project.

3. **Automation Tools Integration (Week 3)**  
   - I practiced integrating ChatGPT with the Gamma app to automatically generate presentations and documents.  
   - I saw the potential for real-world use by auto-summarizing analysis results into structured formats.

4. **Advanced GPTs + GitHub Integration (Week 4)**  
   - Although the course was scheduled through July 2, I completed all core lessons by early week 4.  
   - I’ve since focused on advanced GPT functions and building automation tools with GitHub to prepare for AI-based content creation and blog automation.

5. **After the Course – My Own Use Cases**  
   - Even after the official end date of June 15, I’ll continue learning until July 2, focusing on report automation, image analysis, and AI-powered writing.  
   - I plan to apply ChatGPT in preparing for the national judicial scrivener exam and pursuing my dream of becoming a writer.

📝 Final Thoughts  
Being able to take such a hands-on AI course through government support was a huge stroke of luck.  
This wasn’t just about using ChatGPT as a tool—it was about building a foundation for generating content and automation in my own workflow.  
I plan to apply this experience to blogging, automation, and image-based projects going forward.  
Below are 3 sample images representing some of the work I’ve done using ChatGPT during the course.
